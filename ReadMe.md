This project was a part of my Embedded Systems course, it is a UART-driver for the STM32F411x microcontroller wich controls a LED.

The Documentation folder contains my report for this school project

The Hardware folder contains the Data sheet, Reference manual and User guide for the STM32F4 platform used in this project

The SourceCode folder contains UART drivers that enables LED to switch between four different colors and turn on or off



These are the functions used to run the drivers:

USART2_Init: Initialize USART-protocol

USART2_write: Send data using UART communication

USART2_read: Receive data using UART communication
